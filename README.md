# ðŸš€ AWS Blue-Green Deployment with Terraform & CI/CD Automation

This project demonstrates a **Blue-Green Deployment strategy on AWS** using **Terraform** for Infrastructure as Code (IaC), and **CI/CD Automation** to handle seamless, zero-downtime deployments. The deployment leverages EC2 instances behind an Application Load Balancer (ALB), allowing easy switching between blue and green environments for staging and production.

## Tools and Technologies Used

- Terraform  
- AWS EC2  
- AWS ALB (Application Load Balancer)  
- CI/CD with GitHub Actions  
- Apache Web Server  
- SSH & Security Groups  
- Ubuntu Linux  
- Visual Studio Code  
- Canva (for architecture diagram)

## Architecture Diagram

![Architecture Diagram](Untitled%20design.png)

This diagram shows the infrastructure layout, which includes two sets of EC2 instances (blue and green environments), an ALB to switch between them, security groups, and networking components.

## Folder Structure


## Implementation Steps

I began by configuring the AWS provider in the `provider.tf` file, defining the region and backend configuration. I then used multiple `.tf` files to keep the infrastructure modular and cleanâ€”`main.tf`, `alb.tf`, `blue.tf`, `green.tf`, etc.

I created the networking setup, security groups for SSH (port 22) and HTTP (port 80), and then provisioned two EC2 instances for the blue and green environments. Each EC2 instance had a startup script to install Apache and display a distinct webpage for identification.

After the compute resources were deployed, I configured an Application Load Balancer to route traffic between the environments. The ALB target groups were defined to switch between blue and green deployments without downtime.

I outputted key information such as public IPs and key pair names for testing SSH and browser-based validation.

## Problems Faced & Solutions

**Problem 1:** Could not SSH into the EC2 instance.  
**Solution:** I realized I forgot to add port 22 to the inbound rules of the security group. After updating the rule and reapplying Terraform, I was able to SSH successfully.  

**Problem 2:** Ping to EC2 instanceâ€™s public IP was failing.  
**Solution:** The default firewall on the Ubuntu EC2 instance (UFW) was active. I disabled it for testing and also confirmed that ICMP was allowed in the security group if needed.  

**Problem 3:** Terraform output didnâ€™t show EC2 public IPs.  
**Solution:** I fixed this by adding correct resource references in the `outputs.tf` file:

```hcl
output "blue_instance_ip" {
  value = aws_instance.blue.public_ip
}


Key Takeaways
Successfully implemented zero-downtime deployments using the Blue-Green model.

Practiced modular and reusable Terraform code for AWS infrastructure.

Set up and tested secure EC2 access, Apache deployment, and traffic routing via ALB.

Troubleshot real-world cloud and networking issues and solved them efficiently.

Created visual documentation using Canva and took real implementation screenshots.

Next Steps
Add GitHub Actions pipeline to automate blue-green switching.

Implement health checks for auto-routing based on instance health.

Use Route 53 for domain-level traffic failover.

Expand architecture with database tier and monitoring.
